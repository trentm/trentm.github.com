<p>We hope to be switching over from the <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook">ASPN Cookbooks</a> to the new <a href="http://code.activestate.com/">ActiveState Code</a> site today. Please be patient if the site is down for a short while. We expect the process to take about an hour or two late this afternoon (<a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fullscreen.html?n=256">PST</a>).</p>

<p>I've had lots of good feedback from the Python community (Apologies if I haven't gotten back to you yet. I will.) and have made a number of changes based on that feedback. I'll post more details once the site has been switched over.</p>
