<p>I've been remiss in not blogging about my new daughter until now... tada! A lovely little girl. 7lb 4oz. Born on July 4th. All the appropriate bits. Everyone healthy. At times ominous hospital experience, but all good in the end. Ewan's (her almost 2 year old brother) latest thing is to kiss her on the forehead repeatedly. Big wet ones.</p>
