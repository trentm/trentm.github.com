The [March VanPyZ meeting](http://wiki.python.org/moin/VanPyZ#NextEvent) will be hosted at ActiveState this coming Tuesday evening (*tomorrow!*). **I posted [details on my work blog](http://blogs.activestate.com/2010/03/march-vancouver-python-user-group-vanpyz-tuesday-at-activestate/).** We'll be trying out a slightly new thing: Lightning talks, a short 5 minute talk on whatever [^1]. The Lightning Talk format works so well at PyCon. See my work blog post for more details. See you there.

"VanPyZ" is the Vancouver Python user group.

[^1]: In my email to the VanPyZ list I promised a beer to whoever presents. :) Send me a one-liner on what you'd like to talk about.
