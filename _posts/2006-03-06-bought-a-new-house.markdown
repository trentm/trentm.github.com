<p>My fiancee and I bought a new house today! Phew. Buying a house in Vancouver (North Van in this case), sucks. It is waay too competitive. But we got a little lucky and won among a number of offers. I tend to cringe at blowing $20 gambling of an evening (more recently losing that to friends playing poker). It is definitely more stressful waiting for two hours when real money is on the line.</p>

<p>I am now poor. :)</p>
