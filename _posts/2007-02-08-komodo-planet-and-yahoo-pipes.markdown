<p>I played a bit with Yahoo's new <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Pipes</a> web app. At ActiveState we have a <a href="http://blogs.activestate.com/jeffg/">number</a> <a href="http://blogs.activestate.com/shanec/">of</a> <a href="http://blogs.activestate.com/ericp/">blogs</a> where many of <a href="http://blogs.activestate.com/trentm/">us</a> write about what interesting things we are working on. A number of those posts are about <a href="http://www.activestate.com/products/komodo_ide/">Komodo</a>. As well, with the recent 4.0 release, Komodo has started popping up on blogs more and more -- in particular, the very cool <a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/bcorfman/index.html">"Komodo Hacks" series</a> from Brandon.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, I give you the <strong><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/nqXO3Ae42xGRdNG8qu5lkA/">Komodo Planet Pipe</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Let me know if there are other blogs I should add to this. Currently it just filters on posting <em>titles</em> matching "Komodo". I tried to also include filtering on the posting <em>content</em> but Yahoo Pipes kept giving me (unhelpful) errors with that. I like the idea of Pipes, but overall I found the current experience to be too unresponsive to be pleasing.</p>
