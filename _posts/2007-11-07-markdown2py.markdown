<p>I've started a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-markdown2/">python-markdown2</a> project: this is another Python implementation of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows 
  you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then 
  convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No release package yet (setup.py, setuptools, easy_install, ez_setup? -- my head is spinning), but you can get the file directly from SVN: <a href="http://python-markdown2.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/markdown2.py">markdown2.py</a>.</p>

<p>This is the first project for which I am really using <a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/">Google Code project hosting</a>. I'm really digging it. Nice bug tracker, nice enough wiki (<em>all</em> wikis should use a source control system as their backend), svn. Goodbye sourceforge.</p>
