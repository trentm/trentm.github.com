I'm moving my blog from Blogger <http://trentmick.blogspot.com> back to
**<http://trentm.com>** (hosted on Github Pages). *Apologies for all the
"new" posts in your feed reader.*

My feed URL is <http://feeds.feedburner.com/trentmick>. However, most of you
(all 7 of my readers) shouldn't have to do anything to update.
