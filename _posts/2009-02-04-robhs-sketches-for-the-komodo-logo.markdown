<p>Rob Hernandez is an ex-<a href="http://www.activestate.com/">ActiveState</a> employee. When he worked here he was responsible for the excellent designs that became the ActiveState critter logos -- since, and still, used on t-shirts and for ActiveState application logos.</p>

<p>I was happy to see that he recently put up some of his work on Flickr:</p>

<p>including his sketches for the Komodo head logo:</p>

<p>The latter are the precursor to the current Komodo IDE and Komodo Edit head icons:</p>
