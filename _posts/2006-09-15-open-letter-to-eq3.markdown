<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I am writing to inform you that the customer service I
received recently from <a href="http://www.eq3.com/">EQ3</a> in Vancouver was totally
unacceptable. Please forward this message to the
appropriate person.</p>

<p>I ordered a Connick Pendant Lamp from your Yaletown
Store on 10th June 2006 and was told that it would be
delivered to the store in 2-3 weeks. When I called
after 4 weeks to see if the lamp had arrived, I was
then told that the 2-3 weeks was actually delivery
time to Winnipeg and I would have to wait another week
or so for the lamp to arrive in Vancouver.</p>

<p>Three <em>months</em> later in September I received a phone
call from Kevin Smith [not his real name] indicating that the lamp had
arrived in Vancouver. No apology for the delay was
forthcoming. I was also informed that it could not be
delivered to the Yaletown store and I would have to
pick it up from the warehouse in a completely
different area of Vancouver. As the warehouse was only
open 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday, I took 2 hours off
work and drove out of my way to collect the lamp on
September 15th.</p>

<p>On arrival at the warehouse, I was notified by the
warehouse employee that the truck that was meant to
arrive the previous day had been delayed and that all
customers should have been contacted. I was also
notified that my lamp was destined to be delivered to
the Yaletown store so I wasn't expected to come and
pick it up anyway.</p>

<p>Customer service up to this point had been substandard
to say the least but degenerated to disgraceful when I
called up Kevin Smith to inform him of the situation.
Without any understanding of my circumstances he
informed me that my drive to the warehouse was hardly
out of my way and really, could eq3 be expected to
call everybody and inform them of the delay? With this
level of customer service, EQ3 cannot expect any of
their current customers to shop in the store again and
I have been left with a very poor opinion of the
company.</p>

<p>I instructed Kevin Smith to refund my payment for the
lamp and I am waiting to ensure this happens. If EQ3
wishes to be a successful franchise company I would
recommend that it puts some effort into customer
satisfaction.</p>
