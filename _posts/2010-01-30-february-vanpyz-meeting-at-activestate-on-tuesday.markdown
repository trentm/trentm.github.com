The [February VanPyZ meeting](http://wiki.python.org/moin/VanPyZ#NextEvent) will be hosted at ActiveState this coming Tuesday evening. **I posted [details on my work blog](http://blogs.activestate.com/2010/01/vanpyz-vancouver-python-user-group-tuesday-at-activestate/).** Myself and Michael Gr√ºnewald will be speaking on [recent ActiveState Code work](http://code3.activestate.com) and Brett Cannon will be speaking on his [importers project](http://code.google.com/p/importers/).  See you there.

"VanPyZ" is the Vancouver Python user group.
