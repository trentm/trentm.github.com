I'm back from [PyCon 2010](http://us.pycon.org/2010/about/) in Atlanta
(actually I've been back for almost two weeks now, but I'm a lazy writer).
PyCon, as usual, was a great time. I wrote a long wrap-up on my work blog
here:

A couple more personal additions...
<!-- more -->

- I announced [Python Translation
  Party](http://pythontranslationparty.appspot.com) during PyCon --
  [here](http://trentmick.blogspot.com/2010/02/python-translation-party.html),
  [here](http://trentmick.blogspot.com/2010/02/updated-python-translation-party-fewer.html),
  and in a Lightning Talk (video not up yet) -- to a resounding golf clap. :)
  It is a small site devoted to translating Python code between 2 and 3 using
  the lib2to3 and lib3to2 libraries until "equilibrium" is found. Mostly it
  was a fun little play with AppEngine. However, it has also resulted in a
  few bug reports to lib3to2 and lib2to3, which is cool.
  
- I had a good chat with [Catherine
  Devlin](http://catherinedevlin.blogspot.com/) about her
  [cmd2](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cmd2) library, because it is so similar
  in spirit to my [cmdln](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cmdln) library. We
  chatted a bit about whether a merging of the two libs would be reasonable.
  No concrete plans: busy busy.


It was great to hook up with people that I tend to only see at PyCon.
I look forward to PyCon next year.
