<p>A week or two ago I noticed that the theme I was using with my WordPress blog (the default one in WP 1.5, based on <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/kubrick/">Kubrik</a>) was pretty broken when viewed in IE6. I thought that <a href="http://ascher.ca/blog/">David's blog</a> was also using the default WP 1.5 theme, but his didn't seem as broken.</p>

<p>In any case, I wanted to fix that and also make the other bits of my website (such as it is) relatively not unpleasant to look at. I've finally <a href="https://trentm.com/">done</a> <a href="https://trentm.com/blog/">that</a>. Tada. :)  The general styling borrows somewhat from <a href="http://mozilla.org/">mozilla.org</a> (which is one of the cleaner sites around, IMO) and, of course, my WP theme is heavily based on the default Kubrik.</p>

<p>I've also setup my site build system so that I can write a simple little <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> file, prefixed with a little XML metadate snippet, to get relatively good looking HTML page.  For example: <a href="https://trentm.com/software/index.markdown.txt">source</a> and <a href="https://trentm.com/software/">result</a>.</p>
