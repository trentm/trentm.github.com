<p>Why doesn't the <a href="http://www.apple.com/mightymouse/">mighty mouse</a> have a <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/features.html">click wheel</a>?</p>

<p>[Update] Okay, dumb question. A thumb goes in a circle more easily than an index finger. We got a new iMac/Intel box in the office recently -- which shipped with a mighty mouse. I haven't played with it that much, but the buttons-that-aren't-really-buttons would take some getting used to.</p>
