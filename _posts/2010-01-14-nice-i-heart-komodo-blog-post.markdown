Nice post on Komodo (comparing to other editors): <a href="http://bshensky.livejournal.com/19843.html">Sayonara TextPad, Hello Komodo Edit</a><br />
<br />
<blockquote>So, who makes an FOSS-friendly editor for Windows with the best UI that leverages Scintilla?<br />
<br />
In the end, I settled on Komodo Edit.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
What clinched the deal was (a) the tour of the UI that really appeared to be thoughtfully considered by its designers, and (b) the design team which has its roots in support of Perl and other FOSS initiatives for the Windows platform.  What was clear to me was that the guys at ActiveState punched away in the same languages as I did, and clearly understood what would make a best of breed coding editor, then they just went ahead and built one!<br />
