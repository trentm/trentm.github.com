title: Donating blood in downtown Vancouver

I like to try to donate blood regularly (you're allow to donate every 56 days).
It is an easy thing to do to help the system. But really I'm just in it for the
**free cookies** at the end of it. There is no other way I can justify my
having an Oreo at 10am. Here is how in downtown Vancouver (where I work):
