<p>I'm off to <a href="http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2007/">FSSOS</a> in a few hours.  <a href="http://www.activestate.com/">We'll</a> be opening up the Komodo sources next Wednesday, so <a href="http://blogs.activestate.com/shanec/">Shane</a> and I will be there to start the discussion about what <a href="http://www.activestate.com/openkomodo/">Open Komodo</a> and <a href="http://www.activestate.com/openkomodo/details.plex">Snapdragon</a> should focus on to best improve the tool story for open web development. (Currently the Open Komodo sources are available to a small group of mozillians. If you have some ideas and would like to take a peek, let me know and I'll hook you up!)</p>

<p>I'm hoping to meet a few of the Mozilla folks that will be there: <a href="http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/blog/2007-10-03/fsoss-2007/">Benjamin</a> to ask about breakpad (I want to get breakpad running for Open Komodo and <a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodoide/">Komodo</a> builds), looking forward to <a href="http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2007/presentationDetails.php?presentationID=29">Mike Beltzner's talk on UE design at Mozilla</a>, <a href="http://www.bitstampede.com/2007/10/03/dont-forget-to-fsoss/">Eric Shephed</a> to ask about how mozilla handles localization of their docs.</p>

<p>As well, if any of the mozilla folks involved in the <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/AUS">AUS</a> will be there, I'd love to talk with you to compare notes with Komodo's auto-update system.</p>
