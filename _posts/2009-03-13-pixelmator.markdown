<p>In the bright pre-recession days of 2008 I, and a bunch of my co-workers, bought into <a href="http://www.macheist.com/">MacHeist</a>: get a bunch of Mac OS X apps for about $30. One of those apps was <a href="http://www.pixelmator.com/">Pixelmator</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/trento/3352143593/" title="Pixelmator icon by trento, on Flickr"><img src="//farm4.static.flickr.com/3653/3352143593_0a64f552ea_o.png" width="256" height="137" alt="Pixelmator icon" /></a></p><p>Pixelmator is basically a lite Photoshop-clone for Mac OS X. Some thoughts on it:</p><a name='more'></a><br />
<ul><li><p><strong>It's sexy.</strong> Popup-notices when undoing actions. Cute tool pallete (especially like the eye-dropper).</p><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/trento/3352968676/" title="Pixelmator eyedropper tool by trento, on Flickr"><img src="//farm4.static.flickr.com/3446/3352968676_cb38b2bcda_o.png" width="408" height="502" alt="Pixelmator eyedropper tool" /></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>It works.</strong> It is fullfilling my needs for recent work (cutting up screenshots, the odd tweak for images in <a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo/">Komodo</a>. I'm not a graphics guy but I've played enough with Photoshop to suspect that the "lite" I mention above is a good thing for me. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p></li>
<li><p>If it helps others, here is my <a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1301040/blog/2009/03/hyperlink_color.pxm">hyperlink_color.pxm</a> Pixelmator file for the "Komodo color hyperlinks" screenshot in my <a href="http://trentmick.blogspot.com/2009/03/hyperlinks-in-komodo-510b1_1005.html">previous blog post</a>. <a href="http://www.designworkplan.com/signage-symbols/free-vector-arrows.htm">This set of free arrow images</a> is a great resource for slapping arrows into your screenshots.</p></li>
</ul><p>The version that was current when I bought it was a little crashy, but at some point between then and now them seemed to have fixed whatever crashes I was hitting. This is the best $30 I've spent on the web.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn-1"> <p>I'd be interested to hear from anyone who has real experience with Photoshop and Pixelmator if it actually <em>is</em> "lite Photoshop". Poking around the menus there doesn't seem to be a whole lot less in Pixelmator. Perhaps the big part of Photoshop is the set of 3rd party extensions and integration with other tools like Illustrator?&nbsp;<a href="#fnref-1" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p></li>
