[Andy McKay](http://twitter.com/andymckay): **Using SMS in the Developing World**

RapidSMS is an open source project for messaging, data collection and co-ordination over SMS. Itâ€™s used throughout the world for a variety of projects, from fighting child malnutrition and malaria to monitoring elections.

This talk introduces RapidSMS and shows what the library can do. We then cover some of the projects that use it including monitoring children in Malawi and diagnosing children in Kenya. The samples show how the project is used in the real world to make a real difference to people.

This is a talk Andy's going to be [giving at OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/13890).
