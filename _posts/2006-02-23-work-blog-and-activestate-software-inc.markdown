<p style="">I have <a href="http://blogs.activestate.com/trentm/">a work blog</a> now.  Mostly I'll be talking about <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePython/">ActivePython</a> and <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Komodo/">Komodo</a> there.

Of course the <a href="http://blogs.activestate.com/activestate/2006/02/free_as_in_will.html">big news</a> is that we (ActiveState) are spinning out to be an independent company again. The close happened this week and now we are working on moving into our own space. This should be an exciting ride, er, drive (we are in control of our own destiny now).</p>
