I watched [Don Norman's TED Talk "3 ways good design makes you
happy"](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/don_norman_on_design_and_emotion.html)
last night:

</div>

This part of his talk really stuck out for me (transcription errors mine):

> I really had the feeling that pleasant things work better and that never made
> any sense to me, until I finally figured it out. Look:
> 
> I'm gonna put a plank on the ground. So imagine I have a plank about 2' wide
> and 30' long. And I'm going to walk on it. See I can walk on it without
> looking, and go back and forth, and I can jump up and down. No problem. Now I'm
> going to put the plank 300' feet in the air... and I'm not going to go near it,
> thank you. Intense fear paralyzes you. It actually affects the way your brain
> works.
>
> ...
> 
> If you're happy, things work better because you're more creative. You get a
> little problem, you say "Ah, I'll figure it out. No big deal."

Don Norman's ideas may be more relevant to industrial design, but I think this
can safely be applied to software design (more my domain). Don points to how
being fun and beautiful can make something better -- not just seem better, but
*work* better. That's an important point in the common trade off in software
development between spending more time on features or bugs vs. spending some
time on making a UI "pretty". Occassionally in work debates -- whether on
[Komodo](http://www.activestate.com/komodo/) or on some of the
[ActiveState](http://www.activestate.com/) websites I'm involved in -- that
"pretty" is said dismissively. I'm happy to have Don Norman's talk as a debate
point.

BTW, thanks to
[stephen](http://trentm.com/blog/archives/2009/04/24/re-installing-mac-os-x-software-i-use/#comment-2533).
A few weeks ago I reinstalled my Mac book and
[posted](http://trentm.com/blog/archives/2009/04/24/re-installing-mac-os-x-software-i-use/)
a list of the software I use. Stephen suggested I add
[Miro](http://www.getmiro.com/) to that list. Cue many evenings of watching TED
talks (including the above talk) and other programs.
