<p>This is recipe that my parents found in, IIRC, a 1980's Gourmet Christmas special magazine. Our family has been making this relish for Thanksgiving and Christmas turkey dinner every since. I generally prepare this one or two days before the big meal, so it doesn't add to the burden of preparing everything else.</p>

<h1>Cranberry-pear relish</h1>

<p>In a big soup pot bring <strong>1 1/4 cup sugar</strong>, <strong>1 cup water</strong> and <strong>1/4 cup lemon juice</strong> to boil. Simmer for 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Add <strong>5 pears</strong> (peeled, cored and cubed into about 1cm cubes). Simmer for 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Add <strong>3 cups cranberries</strong>. Boil at med-high heat, stirring occasionally until most of the cranberries pop -- usually about 5-10 minutes. "Three cups cranberries" is basically just the entire bag of frozen cranberries that are commonly available at supermarkets around Thanksgiving and Christmas time.</p>

<p>Remove from heat and stir in <strong>1 1/2 tsp lemon rind</strong> (optional), <strong>1/4 tsp cinnamon</strong> and <strong>1/4 tsp allspice</strong>.</p>

<p>Let cool and store in the fridge.</p>
