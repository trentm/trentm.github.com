<p>I love Canada. Couldn't pick a better place to live. And I suppose if the following exercise is one of the worst annoyances in recent memory when dealing with my federal government, then that is a good thing.</p>

<p>How:</p>

<p>pray:</p>

<p>tell: </p>

<p>am I meant to login to the Canada Revenue site to change my address? It is a good thing that <em><a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/agency/menu-e.html">you</a></em> owe <em>me</em> money this year, or it would probably be easier for me to setup a website for <em>you</em> to login and get my tax information.</p>

<p>Computer programming is my day job and I happen to have access to a lot of machines -- one of which is an <em>old</em> Windows 2000 machine that still has IE 6 on it.  I was able to login to the epass system in this browser. However, I suspect that a lot of your users will not be able to login the moment they follow Microsoft's Windows Update prompts to upgrade from IE6 to IE7.</p>
