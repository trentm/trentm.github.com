<p>We launched <a href="http://code.activestate.com/">ActiveState Code</a> today, <a title="You have seen Monty Python's Holy Grail, right?" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=And+There+was+Much+Rejoicing">and there was much rejoicing.</a>  Yaaaah!</p>

<p>ActiveState Code is a site for sharing code recipes. It is the replacement for the popular ASPN Cookbooks (especially the Python Cookbook, which was a collaboration with O'Reilly and Associates that resulted in two print cookbooks using recipes from the site). The new site adds things like <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/tags/">tagging</a>, the ability to <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/add/">add recipes</a> in a number of other <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/">languages</a>, and a fresher and hopefully more usable site. </p>

<p>Migration should be easy. All recipes from the Python, Tcl and PHP Cookbooks have been carried over. Redirects maintain all old aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbooks links. Recipe id and author ids have been maintained. The ASPN Cookbook categories have been translated into tags in the new system -- <a href="http://code.activestate.com/aspnredir/categories/">full details here</a>.</p>

<p>I welcome any <a href="http://code.activestate.com/help/feedback/">feedback</a> on the site.</p>
