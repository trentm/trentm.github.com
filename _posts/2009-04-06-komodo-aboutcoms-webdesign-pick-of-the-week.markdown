<p>Nice to see <a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo_edit/">Komodo Edit</a> get <a href="http://webdesign.about.com/b/2009/04/05/web-design-software-pick-of-the-week-komodo-edit.htm">about.com's Webdesign/HTML blog's pick of the week</a>:</p>

<blockquote>This week I took a look at the latest version of my favorite XML and HTML text editor: Komodo Edit. The new version adds in some nice features like history and search highlighting. I still find this editor to be the <a href="http://webdesign.about.com/od/htmleditorreviews/gr/komodoedit5-1.htm">best free XML and text HTML editor</a> you can get for any operating system. I use it every day.</blockquote>
