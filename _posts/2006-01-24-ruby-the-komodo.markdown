<p>Apparently the San Diego Zoo has <a href="http://www.sandiegozoo.org/kids/animal_komodo.html">a Komodo dragon named Ruby</a>. I declare that girl the mascot of the recent <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Komodo/">Komodo</a> (IDE) release that added <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> <a href="http://www.activestate.com/_images/screenshots/ss_Komodo_rails_large.gif">support</a>. Brilliant. (Thanks for emailing us, Tony!) Bonus points if you noticed that Ruby's tongue is (atypically) yellow -- similar to our Komodo icon's eye. I wonder if they have a Komodo dragon named pearl.</p>
