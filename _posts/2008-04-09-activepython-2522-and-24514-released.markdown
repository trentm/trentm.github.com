<p>After a hiatus while I worked hard on the <a href="http://www.activestate.com/products/komodo/">Komodo 4.3</a> release with the Komodo crew here, I've finally had the chance to update ActivePython 2.5 and 2.4 to the latest.</p>

<p>Full details in the <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/docs/ActivePython/relnotes.html">ActivePython release notes</a>. These releases update the core to Python <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5.2/NEWS.txt">2.5.2</a> and <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.4.5/NEWS.txt">2.4.5</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
