<p>Python 3.0 was released last week and we've <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"> <a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> managed to get ActivePython builds for all our platforms and give them a smoke test. </p>

<p>Now that Python 3.0 is final I'm really looking forward to seeing where Python 3 goes. I'm sure it will be (and feel like) a long transition from Python 2, but I think a year or two from now we'll look back at the rare Python 2 usage not miss it. The semantic changes involved in the str/unicode/bytes changes will be a royal pain, but this had to be done and the long term benefits of sane Unicode handling will be huge.</p>
