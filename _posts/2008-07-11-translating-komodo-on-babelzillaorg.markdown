<p>At the <a href="http://community.activestate.com/forum-topic/localizing-komodo-using-babelzilla-dream-team">prompting</a> of <a href="http://dafizilla.sourceforge.net/">dafi</a> (one of Komodo's more active users) and with <em>goofy</em>'s help I've uploaded a <a href="http://www.babelzilla.org/index.php?option=com_wts&amp;Itemid=88&amp;type=lang&amp;extension=3868">Komodo Language Pack</a> with Komodo's current <code>en-US</code> localization to <a href="http://www.babelzilla.org/">BabelZilla</a>.</p>

<p>We get requests for localizations of Komodo every so often, but lack the resources to do this ourselves. Given a number of good translations here, I can start providing language pack extensions to <a href="http://community.activestate.com/addons">Komodo's add-ons site</a>.</p>

<p>This is a trial balloon that I really hope turns out well. I remember having a great chat with Michal Berman about Mozilla's l10n infrastructure at FSSOS 2007 waaay back in October last year. I dropped that ball following up after that discussion. I'd also like to take a look at <a href="https://translations.launchpad.net/">Launchpad Translations</a> to see if that would work well.</p>

<p>If you are interested in helping out with translating Komodo to your language, please take a look at <a href="http://community.activestate.com/forum-topic/localizing-komodo-using-babelzilla-dream-team">this forum thread</a> and/or let me know (trentm at activestate dot com).</p>
