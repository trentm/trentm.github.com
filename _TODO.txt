- css
- importing a few of my posts: all the markdown/html
    - also move associated images/files from Dropbox to here
- try moving site bits to "www" dir and use "source" config
- disqus
    - e.g. http://html5boilerplate.com/
- importing existing comments
- thinking about redirects: use permalink front matter to get the same
  URLs for all previous posts as on trentmick.blogspot.com
- tags -> categories
    - what is the impact on this on my Mozilla Planet inclusion?!
    - can this do category feeds? might need to manually do that with liquid
- better 404.html
- analytics
- turn lsi and pygments back on
- offer a std "reply to @trentmick on Twitter", which includes enough
  info (bit.ly API?) to track ... and then show that via JS
- plan the switch, <link> for feedburner
- browse http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Sites for interesting ideas
- play with Qunit and test/... from html5boilerplate. Qunit vs. selenium?
- apple-touch-icon.png
- yahoo JS profiling stuff from html5boilerplate (I've removed it)
- **related posts**: jekyll --lsi

    By default, the “related posts” functionality will produce crappy results.
    In order to get high quality results with a true LSI algorithm, you must
    enable it (it may take some time to run if you have many posts):
    
    $ jekyll —lsi
