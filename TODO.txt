- manually importing a few of my posts
    - also move associated images/files from Dropbox to here
- importing existing comments
- thinking about redirects: use permalink front matter to get the same
  URLs for all previous posts as on trentmick.blogspot.com
- tags -> categories
    - what is the impact on this on my Mozilla Planet inclusion?!
    - can this do category feeds? might need to manually do that with liquid
- analytics
- turn pygments back on?
- category/tag listings: try to do this on the index page. ideas:
    - a "by tag" listing, then can just link to an anchor on that page
    - JS to filter the list down by tag
- plan the switch, <link> for feedburner
- if want archives, see http://github.com/henrik/jekyll
  and http://henrik.nyh.se/2009/04/jekyll
  or https://github.com/metajack/metajack.im/blob/master/archive/index.html
- why doesn't my 404.html take for other than /404.html and /404 ?

# typography nerd

- use 'ยง' for section links rather than '#' ?

# lower prio

- offer a std "reply to @trentmick on Twitter", which includes enough
  info (bit.ly API?) to track ... and then show that via JS
- play with Qunit and test/... from html5boilerplate. Qunit vs. selenium?
- apple-touch-icon.png
- yahoo JS profiling stuff from html5boilerplate (I've removed it)
- learn html5boilerplate CSS:
    - The Magnificent CLEARFIX: want example usage of this. Try in h5b site.
    - '.ir' usage example
    - /* www.pathf.com/blogs/2008/05/formatting-quoted-code-in-blog-posts-css21-white-space-pre-wrap/ */
      The post styling is out of date, so play around with it a bit.
    - "fonts.css from the YUI Library: developer.yahoo.com/yui/
      Please refer to developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/ for font sizing percentages
      ...
        * remove arial, helvetica from explicit font stack
        * make the line-height relative and unit-less
        * remove the pre, code styles"
      Understand the sizing and how to use it.
      Understand why H5B had their edits.
