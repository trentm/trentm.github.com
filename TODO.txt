- css:
    - use body text styles from
      http://dailyjs.com/2010/10/11/functional-koans/ ?
      close enough to trentmick.blogpost.com that I should
      just start with the latter
- manually importing a few of my posts
    - also move associated images/files from Dropbox to here
- disqus
    - e.g. http://html5boilerplate.com/
- importing existing comments
- thinking about redirects: use permalink front matter to get the same
  URLs for all previous posts as on trentmick.blogspot.com
- tags -> categories
    - what is the impact on this on my Mozilla Planet inclusion?!
    - can this do category feeds? might need to manually do that with liquid
- analytics
- turn lsi and pygments back on
- category/tag listings: try to do this on the index page. ideas:
    - a "by tag" listing, then can just link to an anchor on that page
    - JS to filter the list down by tag
- offer a std "reply to @trentmick on Twitter", which includes enough
  info (bit.ly API?) to track ... and then show that via JS
- plan the switch, <link> for feedburner
- play with Qunit and test/... from html5boilerplate. Qunit vs. selenium?
- apple-touch-icon.png
- yahoo JS profiling stuff from html5boilerplate (I've removed it)
