# high prio

- default page style:
    - next/previous links to top nav bar?
    - "style" section below
    - footer: work, js badge, search, other links, picture, bio
- gather back all tags from blogger dump
- thinking about redirects: use permalink front matter to get the same
  URLs for all previous posts as on trentmick.blogspot.com
- tag/category pages
- recurring task to pull in old posts (mk pull)
- plan the switch, <link> for feedburner

# How to migration more post comments in disqus

- add new GH _posts/*.html
- add URL to redirect.json
- `mk gen_discus_redir`
- migration at http://trentm.disqus.com/admin/tools/migrate/



# lower prio

- categories:
    - categories in posts (e.g. http://tesoriere.com/2010/08/25/liquid-code-in-a-liquid-template-with-jekyll/, https://github.com/scottkf/tesoriere.com/blob/master/_posts/2010-08-25-liquid-code-in-a-liquid-template-with-jekyll.markdown#L9-17) 
    - category/tag listings: try to do this on the index page. ideas:
        - a "by tag" listing, then can just link to an anchor on that page
        - JS to filter the list down by tag
    - what is the impact on this on my Mozilla Planet inclusion?!
    - can this do category feeds? might need to manually do that with liquid
- if want archives, see http://github.com/henrik/jekyll
  and http://henrik.nyh.se/2009/04/jekyll
  or https://github.com/metajack/metajack.im/blob/master/archive/index.html
- analytics
- move associated images/files from Dropbox to here
- 'mk lint': add link check. add smart-quote check in blockquotes as well
  markdown footnotes. list other markdown-ification features that liquid might not have.
- offer a std "reply to @trentmick on Twitter", which includes enough
  info (bit.ly API?) to track ... and then show that via JS
- typography nerd: use 'ยง' for section links rather than '#' ?
- play with Qunit and test/... from html5boilerplate. Qunit vs. selenium?
- apple-touch-icon.png
- yahoo JS profiling stuff from html5boilerplate (I've removed it)
