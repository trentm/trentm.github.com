    <http://localhost:4000/2010/07/komodo-6-beta-2.html>
    font size: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/#default
    hN

- css:
    - use body text styles from
      http://dailyjs.com/2010/10/11/functional-koans/ ?
      close enough to trentmick.blogpost.com that I should
      just start with the latter
    - wants:
        - h* styling (a la kd)
        - consolas for pre/code, also pre/code styling a la kd
        - consider that cute keyboard styling
- fonts css section note: This is from the html5boilerplate, but I'm ditching
  it:
        /* {{{ fonts: based on <http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/>
         * Notes:
         * - http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/#default
         * - http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.8.2r1/build/fonts/fonts.css
         */
        body { font:13px/1.231 sans-serif; *font-size:small; *font:x-small; }

        table { font-size:inherit; font:100%; }

        select, input, textarea { font:99% sans-serif; }

        /* normalize monospace sizing
         * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki_talk:Common.css/Archive_11#Teletype_style_fix_for_Chrome
         */
        pre, code, kbd, samp { font-family: monospace, sans-serif; }
        /* }}} */
- manually importing a few of my posts
    - also move associated images/files from Dropbox to here
- importing existing comments
- thinking about redirects: use permalink front matter to get the same
  URLs for all previous posts as on trentmick.blogspot.com
- tags -> categories
    - what is the impact on this on my Mozilla Planet inclusion?!
    - can this do category feeds? might need to manually do that with liquid
- analytics
- turn pygments back on?
- category/tag listings: try to do this on the index page. ideas:
    - a "by tag" listing, then can just link to an anchor on that page
    - JS to filter the list down by tag
- plan the switch, <link> for feedburner
- if want archives, see http://github.com/henrik/jekyll
  and http://henrik.nyh.se/2009/04/jekyll
  or https://github.com/metajack/metajack.im/blob/master/archive/index.html
- why doesn't my 404.html take for other than /404.html and /404 ?

# typography nerd

- use 'ยง' for section links rather than '#' ?

# lower prio

- http://lessframework.com/
- offer a std "reply to @trentmick on Twitter", which includes enough
  info (bit.ly API?) to track ... and then show that via JS
- play with Qunit and test/... from html5boilerplate. Qunit vs. selenium?
- apple-touch-icon.png
- yahoo JS profiling stuff from html5boilerplate (I've removed it)
- learn html5boilerplate CSS:
    - The Magnificent CLEARFIX: want example usage of this. Try in h5b site.
    - '.ir' usage example
    - /* www.pathf.com/blogs/2008/05/formatting-quoted-code-in-blog-posts-css21-white-space-pre-wrap/ */
      The post styling is out of date, so play around with it a bit.
    - "fonts.css from the YUI Library: developer.yahoo.com/yui/
      Please refer to developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/ for font sizing percentages
      ...
        * remove arial, helvetica from explicit font stack
        * make the line-height relative and unit-less
        * remove the pre, code styles"
      Understand the sizing and how to use it.
      Understand why H5B had their edits.
