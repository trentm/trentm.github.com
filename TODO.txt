- tags -> categories
    - what is the impact on this on my Mozilla Planet inclusion?!
    - can this do category feeds? might need to manually do that with liquid
- analytics
- turn pygments back on?
- category/tag listings: try to do this on the index page. ideas:
    - a "by tag" listing, then can just link to an anchor on that page
    - JS to filter the list down by tag
- plan the switch, <link> for feedburner
- if want archives, see http://github.com/henrik/jekyll
  and http://henrik.nyh.se/2009/04/jekyll
  or https://github.com/metajack/metajack.im/blob/master/archive/index.html
- why doesn't my 404.html take for other than /404.html and /404 ?

# typography nerd

- apple-touch-icon.png

    - "fonts.css from the YUI Library: developer.yahoo.com/yui/
      Please refer to developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/ for font sizing percentages
      ...
        * remove arial, helvetica from explicit font stack
        * make the line-height relative and unit-less
        * remove the pre, code styles"
      Understand the sizing and how to use it.
      Understand why H5B had their edits.
